# NumMethods_Project2
Application for solving systems of linear equations to calculate the probability of winning in a game of chance. The project has implemented Gauss and Gauss-Seidel method to accomplish this task. Method used to verify results- Monte Carlo.
Old project, code I wrote during my time at university.
